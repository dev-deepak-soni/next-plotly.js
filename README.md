## Plotly.js with Next.js

This is a simple example demonstrating how to use Plotly.js, a powerful charting library, with Next.js, a popular React framework for server-rendered applications. The repository showcases how to integrate interactive and visually appealing charts into your Next.js projects to visualize and analyze data.

### Features:

- **Interactive Charts:** Leverage the capabilities of Plotly.js to create interactive charts, such as bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, pie charts, and more.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensure that the charts are responsive and adapt to various screen sizes for optimal user experience on different devices.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Take advantage of Next.js's server-side rendering for faster initial page loads and improved SEO.
- **Dynamic Loading:** Implement dynamic imports with Next.js to load the Plotly.js library only on the client-side, reducing the initial page load time.
- **Customization:** Customize the appearance of the charts, including colors, labels, tooltips, and axes, to match your project's design and branding.
